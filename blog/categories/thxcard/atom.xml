    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to discover and practice html canvas I worked on a interactive thanks/post card.
This card is composed with a background, and some inner frames containing pictures. By clicking on the background or frames the photos are iterating.</p>

<p><a href="http://lazybean.github.com/thxcard/index.html">
You can see an example there.
</a>
You need to sucessfully pass the tutorial before seeing the actual card.</p>

<p>I use YUI3 framework that helps code organization and good infrastructure; the card and the tutorial are two separated modules loaded on demand in the main script.
Both modules extends widgets to leverage the Attributes and the widget lifecycle.</p>

<p>In the first versions, initial logging was quite long, because all photos have to be loaded initially. Now, only the first photos are loaded at the beginning; the others are loaded when needed; therefore I can include as many photos as I want without impactict loading time.</p>

<p>Differents backgrounds have different configurations (number and position of frames). The modules can easily be reused for other interactives cards.</p>
